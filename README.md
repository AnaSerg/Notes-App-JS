### About
---
It’s a simple notes app. User can add, edit, read and delete notes. Also it’s possible to find any notes using the search bar at the top of the page. If no notes have been added yet, there will be the message about it. The same functionality helps the user to search for notes in the search bar. All added notes are stored in localStorage.

### What I plan to improve
